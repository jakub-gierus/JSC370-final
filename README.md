My JSC370 Final Project Website.

For my final JSC370 project, I analyzed a Jeopardy!, the quiz game show, dataset. 

The project website can be found here: https://jakub-gierus.github.io/JSC370-final/

The written pdf report can be found here: https://github.com/jakub-gierus/JSC370-final/blob/master/Jeopardy%20Data%20Analysis.pdf
